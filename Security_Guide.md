5. Privacy & Zero-Knowledge Proofs
5.1 Privacy Architecture
5.1.1 Privacy by Design Principles
Seven Foundational Principles:
Proactive not Reactive: Anticipate privacy invasions
Privacy as the Default: Maximum privacy without action
Full Functionality: No unnecessary trade-offs
End-to-End Security: Secure data from creation to destruction
Visibility and Transparency: Open about privacy practices
Respect for User Privacy: User-centric design
Privacy Embedded in Design: Core component, not add-on
5.1.2 Data Minimization
Collection Principles:
Necessity Test: Collect only essential data
Purpose Specification: Clear data usage purposes
Retention Limits: Automatic data deletion
Use Limitation: Data used only for stated purposes
5.2 Zero-Knowledge Proof System
5.2.1 ZKP Implementation
ZKP Capabilities:
Selective Disclosure: Prove properties without revealing values
Range Proofs: Prove values within ranges without disclosure
Membership Proofs: Prove set membership without revealing set
Identity Verification: Verify identity without revealing details
ZKP Protocol Flow:
Prover (Profile Owner) ←→ Verifier (System/Third Party)
        ↓
1. Prover generates commitment to secret values
2. Prover creates zero-knowledge proof
3. Proof sent to verifier (no secret data transmitted)
4. Verifier validates proof mathematically
5. Verification result (true/false) returned

5.2.2 ZKP Use Cases
Profile Verification:
{
  "zkp_request": {
    "profile_id": "alice_researcher",
    "prove": [
      {
        "field": "expertise_level",
        "condition": "greater_than",
        "threshold": "intermediate"
      },
      {
        "field": "certification_status", 
        "condition": "equals",
        "value": "verified"
      }
    ]
  },
  "zkp_proof": {
    "proof": "0x1a2b3c...",
    "verified": true,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}

Age Verification Example:
// Prove age > 18 without revealing actual age
const ageProof = generateZKProof({
  secret: user.age, // 25 (not transmitted)
  statement: "age > 18",
  proof_type: "range_proof"
});

// Verifier confirms proof without learning age
const isAdult = verifyZKProof(ageProof); // true

5.3 Privacy Controls
